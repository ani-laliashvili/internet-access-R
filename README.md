# Internet Access
The goal of this project was to model worldwide internet access in 2001-2018 on GDP PPP, Continent, HDI, and the Press Freedom Index variables to determine how 
the wealth, freedom, location, and human development of a country correlate to the internet access of its population. 

This code formats the data, runs the classic ordinary least squares regression, a two-ways fixed effects model, 
a random effects model and conducts the Hausman Test in R.
